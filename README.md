# SecureWalletTester

## Overview
SecureWalletTester is an open-source tool designed to automate security and functionality testing for Ethereum wallets, such as MetaMask. It leverages GitHub Actions for CI/CD, TestCafe for end-to-end testing, and APIs like Alchemy to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. The tool aims to reduce vulnerabilities in wallet implementations, benefiting developers and users in the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Goals
- Automate testing of wallet features (e.g., key generation, token support).
- Integrate with MetaMask for seamless testing.
- Provide a reusable framework for Ethereum developers.
- Publish as an open-source project under the MIT license.

## Planned Features
- Test suite for private key validation and token interactions (ERC-20/ERC-721).
- CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for automated testing.
- Documentation for setup, usage, and community contributions.

## Status
This project is in the planning phase, with development starting upon approval of the Ethereum Foundationâ€™s Ecosystem Support Program grant. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
